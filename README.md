# sol-tomcat

Provides a JMS Resource Factory for the Tomcat JNDI store to call out to a Solace JNDI store
as needed. This can be used to configure Servlets that are deployed under Tomcat to access
Solace JMS resources such as Connection Factories, Topics and Queues without any vendor-specific
servlet code.

For example, the following sample HttpServlet code uses @Resource injection to retrieve a JMS ConnectionFactory, Queue and
Topic via the sample ObjectFactory. 

```
public class mywebsample extends HttpServlet {
    private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(solwebsample.class);
    @Resource(name = "jms/ConnectionFactory")
    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;
    @Resource(name = "jms/Queue")
    Queue queue;
    MessageConsumer queueConsumer;
    @Resource(name = "jms/Topic")
    Topic topic;
    ...
}
```

# Build

This is a Maven2 project with dependencies on public libraries that should build via mvn directly.

```
sol-tomcat% mvn install
[INFO] Scanning for projects...

```

# Deploy

Install the Solace libraries and sol-tomcat-X.Y.Z.jar into the `[TOMCAT]/lib/` directory.

Add the resource configuration to the serverâ€™s `[TOMCAT]/conf/context.xml` and it will be available to
any deployed application. If you have problems accessing it, do not flail around putting the Resource in
different places. Concentrate on fixing your application.

Create a webapp/servlet project with whatever your preferred toolset; HttpServlet is recommended for 
ease of use. Package your build artifacts as a .WAR file, and deploy the app to Tomcat.
